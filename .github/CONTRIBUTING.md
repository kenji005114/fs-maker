## Development Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The exact node version used by this project is located in the `.nvmrc` file.
> If you are using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can run `nvm use` to switch to the correct version.

You will need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
corepack enable pnpm
```

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Please read [WXT Documentation](https://wxt.dev/get-started/introduction.html) for more information on how to develop and test the extension.

### Setup Dev Environment

#### Chrome/Edge

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

After executing the above command, visit **chrome extensions page** `chrome://extensions/`, and click `Load unpacked` button, then select the `.output/chrome-mv3` folder in the project root directory, and try modifying the source code. You'll get live update.


### Get build target(.zip)

This `zip` command will package the directory generated by the `pnpm run build` command into a zip file suitable for the browser extension store.

#### Chrome/Edge: `.output/chrome-mv3.zip`

```bash
pnpm run zip
```


### E2E Test

In order to test browser extensions, playwright needs to use the `headless=new` mode, which can cause the behavior of `playwright test` and `playwright test --ui` to be inconsistent at times, be sure to use `playwright test` to ensure that the test passes.

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```
