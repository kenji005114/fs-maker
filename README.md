## Features

- By default, furigana is automatically added to many [common Japanese websites](https://github.com/aiktb/FuriganaMaker/blob/main/assets/rules/selector.json).
- The list of rules used by Auto Mode can be customized using CSS selectors and domains.
- Users can use their mouse to select areas on any web page to add furigana to.
- N5 & N4 kanji filter prepared for JLPT learners, these kanji will not be added furigana.
